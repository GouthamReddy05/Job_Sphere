# Job_Sphere

An advanced AI-powered platform to analyze resumes against job descriptions, identify missing skills, generate interview questions, and suggest project ideas. The system also fetches live job postings based on the user‚Äôs role and location.

This repository contains the frontend (React + TypeScript) and backend (Flask + LangChain) code, along with integration for embeddings, NLP models, and job search APIs.

## üéØ Project Overview

Job seekers often struggle to understand how well their resumes align with job requirements. Recruiters, on the other hand, receive hundreds of applications and need quick filtering.

This project bridges the gap by:

Analyzing resumes against job descriptions.

Calculating an JAS (Job Analysis System) Score.

Suggesting missing skills to improve resumes.

Generating project ideas tailored to the job role.

Creating interview questions (technical + general).

Fetching live job postings with links based on the role and location.

## üíæ Data & Models

The project uses a combination of NLP models and APIs:

Resume Parsing: pdfminer, PyPDF2, python-docx, pdfplumber.

Scoring & Embeddings: gensim, nltk, GloVe model (to calculate similarity score).

Search Integration: Google Search API (google-search-results).

RAG + Reasoning: LangChain, LangChain-Community, Ollama.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. Frontend (React + TypeScript)

Signup/Login page with animations.

Resume upload (supports .pdf and .docx).

2. Backend (Flask)
